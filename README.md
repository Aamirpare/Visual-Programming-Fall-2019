# Visual-Programming-Fall-2019
This is a very long course that you have to complete in a very short time span. You might have come through the java programming course previously which is taught as a subject through out the semester time span. This course not only covers the c# programming language that alone is eqvivalent to java programing course but you have to go through various application types i.e. WinForms, WPF, ASP.NET Forms application, ASP.NET MVC applications, Entity Framwork, LINQ, Data Annotations, HTML, CSS, SCSS and lot more...
General disscussion, the guidelines, course ouline, evaluvation system and tools and technologies usually discussed in my first introductory lecture would provide you an overview that how fast we require to go to cover the topics of this course throught the semester.
